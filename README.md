# Football Data Widget

A widget for displaying football data.

Write-up:

Overall, this project was very fun and interesting. In total, I spent between 7-8 hours on it including research (stack
overflow, mostly =]). There are tons of UI features I would have liked to include and could easily implement but then I 
would be spending much longer on it than was asked. I'm also not super pleased with the logic within the useTeamData
hook, as the time and space complexity could be improved. However, I believe the way it's currently implemented is 
optimal because all of these loops run at the very beginning of the app starting, speeding up the app when flicking 
through tabs (opposed to sorting this data on each tab change).  

Although I would probably do a lot of thing different if I could start again, I enjoyed this project, and can't wait
to hear some feedback from Checkd. Thanks for the opportunity!
